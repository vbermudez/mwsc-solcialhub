# Google Challenge Scholarship: Mobile Web

## Offline-first Social Hub web application

The goal of this project is to put in practice the Offline-first techniques, as shown in the program of this challenge scholarship, to build a Offline-first social hub. That means, a way to concentrate publications from social networks like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Linkedin, etc in one single page.

In order to NOT create any discussion of which frameworks to use, which technologies, etc; I think this should be done using nothing else but HTML5, CSS3 and, of course, ES6!.

The web application should be focused as a client one. Meaning: no server part, nor back-end (except for a basic HTTP server, of course).

The objective isn't to introduce clien or server frameworks/APIs, nor learn how to design or create web sites. The main objective is to create a colaborative project, so we (students) can put in practice what we learned, and help each other to improve and assimilate the concepts.

It would be great to host this project in various Github accounts, in order to form groups, so the project could evolve in various ways and, why not, have some competition between all those groups! (just for fun and improvement).
